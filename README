# Thesis – H3K79 in Arabidopsis (working repo)

This repository contains the working materials for my PhD thesis on
**histone H3K79 post-translational modifications in _Arabidopsis thaliana_**.
It integrates experimental results, code, figures and links to public datasets.

> Nota: El título definitivo de la tesis está aún en definición.  
> Aquí se documenta la estructura científica y técnica del manuscrito.

## 1. Scope of the thesis

The thesis focuses on:

- Proteomic readout of the **histone code** in plants.
- Detection and quantification of **H3K79me1/2/3 and H3K79ac** in _Arabidopsis_.
- Development and validation of **EpiProfile_PLANTS**, an adaptation of
  EpiProfile 2.0 for plant histone proteomics.
- Application of this workflow to:
  - A developmental gradient in the Arabidopsis rosette (leaf ontogeny).
  - Public datasets on chromatin instability and genotoxic stress (_PXD046034_).
- Reproducible pipelines from **WIFF/RAW → mzML → MS1/MS2 → hPTM matrices**.

## 2. Planned chapter structure

The current working structure (UNIOVI style) is:

1. **Chapter 1 – Introduction and objectives**  
   - Plant chromatin and epigenomic regulation (DNA methylation, histone PTMs, remodelers, ncRNA).  
   - Leaf senescence as a developmental gradient in the Arabidopsis rosette (BGSR).  
   - Why proteomic readout of histone PTMs in plants.  
   - Objectives and working hypotheses of the thesis.

2. **Chapter 2 – EpiProfile_PLANTS: a reproducible workflow for plant histone proteomics**  
   - Adaptation of EpiProfile 2.0 to plants (Arabidopsis, Marchantia, Chlamydomonas).  
   - Software architecture: orchestration, histone catalogs/layouts, MS preprocessing,
     core quantification, QC/auditing, reporting and good practices (GPL-3, FAIR).  
   - Validation on public datasets (e.g. PXD010102, PXD046034) and internal controls.  

3. **Chapter 3 – Histone PTM landscapes across Arabidopsis leaf ontogeny (BGSR)**  
   - Experimental design: four stages of rosette development (Young, Bottom, Floor, Senescence).  
   - LC–MS/MS acquisition and histone proteomics workflow.  
   - State-of-the-art exploratory data analysis (EDA) and differential analysis of hPTMs.  
   - Focus on H3K79 marks as a case study (first detection and quantitative patterns).  

4. **Chapter 4 – Reanalysis of dataset PXD046034 with EpiProfile_PLANTS**  
   - Description of the original study (chromatin instability / genotoxic stress context).  
   - Open and reproducible re-analysis using the plant-specific workflow.  
   - hPTM profiles, QC, normalization and statistical models.  
   - Interpretation in the framework of plant chromatin biology.  
   - (Multi-omics integration is considered as future work, not part of the core results.)

5. **Chapter 5 – General discussion and conclusions**  
   - Synthesis of results from Chapters 2–4.  
   - Biological interpretation of H3K79 dynamics in development and stress.  
   - Methodological contributions: from WIFF to biology in plant histone proteomics.  
   - Limitations and future directions (software, datasets, experimental validation).  

Appendices and supplementary material will host extended tables, additional figures,
and detailed protocol descriptions.

## 3. Repository layout (planned)

This repository will be progressively organised as follows:

- `chapters/` – Drafts and final versions of each chapter (LaTeX/Quarto/Markdown).  
- `figures/` – Source files for figures (R scripts, Illustrator/Inkscape, etc.).  
- `tables/` – TSV/CSV tables used in the main text and supplements.  
- `data-manifests/` – Manifests describing which PRIDE datasets (PXD) are used,
  with links and checksums.  
- `analysis-notebooks/` – R/Python notebooks for EDA, statistics and plotting.  
- `supplementary/` – Material for online supplements or additional files.  

At this stage many of these folders may still be empty or under construction.
